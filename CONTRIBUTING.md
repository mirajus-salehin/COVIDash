# Contribution

If you're new to contributing to Open Source on Github, [this guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/) can help you get started. Please check out the guidline below for more details on how issues and pull requests work.


# Contributing Guidelines

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! ðŸ˜„

Contributions are handled in the form of Pull Requests. You fork this repository, create a new branch, make relevant changes, and submit a Pull Request â€“ once that's done we'll be able to review your PRs and merge them to the master branch.

Always submit a PR for your contribution. If an issue doesn't exist, please raise one first and wait for it to be labelled as "Available", and then have it assigned to you. PRs without having accepted issues mentioned will be closed.

## Process Flow

- When a new issue is created, please label it corretly as per your issue (e.g. "Bug","Feature request").
- If you have new PR, please do it in different branch.

## Formatting

Format your PR titles likewise:

> [Tag]: Describe change in present tense

Tag can be:

- Feature (new feature)
- Fix (bug fix)
- Refactor (refactoring code)
- Style (formatting, no code change)
- Doc (changes to documentation)
- Test (adding or refactoring tests; no production code change)

Remember to:

- Capitalize the subject line
- Use the imperative mood in the subject line
